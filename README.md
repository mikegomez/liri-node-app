LIRI - Node - App

Liri is a siri like application, where you can request certain requests from the application and the app will use apis to retrieve the information. The app uses api's from Twitter, Spotify, and OMBI. 

I used the following techologies:

Twitter
Node-Spotify-API
Request
OMDB API.
DotEnv

The application will be able to pull tweets from the user and display them on the screen, it can generate data from retweets and/or the users feed. 

The Spotify Api is able to pull artists, songs, preview link, and the album from which it's from

The OMBI is able to pull a lot of detail from a selected movie including - Title of the movie.
   * Year the movie came out.
   * IMDB Rating of the movie.
   * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
   * Country where the movie was produced.
   * Language of the movie.
   * Plot of the movie.
   * Actors in the movie.

This is a great app working with Node, pulling data from API's and the internet.
